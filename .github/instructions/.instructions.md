## 🔎 Project Overview

**WorkSight** is a **centralized task and burnout monitoring dashboard** built
for the enterprise workplace. It helps organizations measure employee
productivity and detect early signs of burnout by integrating data from task
management and ERP platforms into a unified view.

This project was built for the **DATAWAVE 2025 competition** under the theme:
_“Workplace Productivity & Future of Work.”_

## 🚀 What We Built

- **Task Management (Core)**
  - Create, update, delete, and move tasks (persistent with Supabase).
  - Kanban board with drag & drop support.

- **Burnout Metrics (Unique Value)**
  - Calculates a **Burnout Score** from task workload patterns (overdue, active
    WIP, etc.).
  - Displays employee, team, and org-level insights on the dashboard.

- **Connectors (Extensible)**
  - Modular architecture for integrations with apps like Trello, Jira, and Odoo.
  - In this prototype: Trello connector demo imports tasks into WorkSight.

- **Reliability & Monitoring**
  - Web Vitals tracking for performance.
  - `/api/health` endpoint for uptime monitoring.
  - Integrated with Vercel Analytics & external uptime tools (UptimeRobot).

- **Authentication**
  - Supabase-powered login system.
  - OAuth providers supported: Google, GitHub, Discord, Facebook.

- **Modern Stack**
  - Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript).
  - Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI, Zustand state management.
  - Hosted on Vercel for enterprise-grade scalability.

## 🏆 Why It Matters

- **Problem**: Burnout costs companies billions in lost productivity, attrition,
  and healthcare.
- **Solution**: WorkSight combines task management + AI-driven burnout analytics
  to help HR and managers **spot risks early** and **balance workloads**.
- **Future Vision**: Expand connectors, add predictive ML burnout models, and
  scale to full enterprise observability of employee well-being.

## 📦 Development Guidelines (Custom Copilot Instructions)

### Project Context

This project is a web application built with **React (Next.js 15)** and
**Node.js** (API routes with Supabase).

### Indentation

We use **tabs**, not spaces.

### Coding Style

- Use **camelCase** for variable names.
- Prefer **arrow functions** over traditional function expressions.

### Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Jest
- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright

## 📌 Roadmap

- ✅ Task CRUD + persistence
- ✅ Burnout Score prototype
- ✅ Trello connector demo
- 🚧 Advanced burnout analytics (AI/ML)
- 🚧 Multi-app connectors (Jira, Odoo, Asana)
- 🚧 Team dashboards & reporting
- 🚧 Predictive burnout alerts

👉 This way, **judges** get the pitch, demo, and competition framing up top,
while **devs/AI copilots** get coding conventions and testing details at the
bottom.

Do you want me to also prepare a **condensed README.md** (almost like a landing
page: logo/title, one-paragraph pitch, demo GIF, quick start) so that your repo
looks crisp at first glance, with `INSTRUCTIONS.md` as the deep dive?
