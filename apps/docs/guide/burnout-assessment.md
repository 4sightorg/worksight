# Burnout Assessment

WorkSight's burnout assessment system provides comprehensive tools to identify,
monitor, and address employee burnout before it becomes critical.

## Overview

The burnout assessment feature is built on scientifically validated
methodologies and provides:

- **Regular Assessment Surveys**: Automated, scheduled burnout evaluations
- **Risk Level Identification**: Classification of burnout risk levels
- **Trend Analysis**: Track burnout levels over time
- **Early Warning System**: Proactive identification of at-risk employees
- **Intervention Recommendations**: Data-driven suggestions for addressing
  burnout

## Assessment Methodology

### Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)

Our assessment is based on the widely recognized Maslach Burnout Inventory,
measuring three core dimensions:

#### 1. Emotional Exhaustion

- Feeling emotionally drained by work
- Physical and mental fatigue
- Reduced energy levels
- Difficulty recovering after work

#### 2. Depersonalization

- Cynical attitudes toward work
- Detachment from colleagues and tasks
- Reduced empathy and engagement
- Treating people as objects rather than individuals

#### 3. Personal Accomplishment

- Feelings of competence and achievement
- Sense of making a meaningful contribution
- Professional efficacy and success
- Personal growth and development

### Additional Dimensions

WorkSight extends traditional burnout assessment with additional factors:

#### 4. Work-Life Balance

- Boundary management between work and personal life
- Time allocation and priorities
- Stress spillover effects
- Recovery and leisure time

#### 5. Organizational Support

- Management support and recognition
- Resource availability
- Workplace culture and environment
- Career development opportunities

```

### Question Types

The assessment includes various question formats:

1. **Likert Scale Questions**

   ```
   "I feel emotionally drained from my work"
   1 - Never
   2 - A few times a year

   4 - A few times a month
   5 - Weekly
   6 - A few times a week
   7 - Daily
   ```

2. **Frequency Questions**

   ```
   "How often do you feel tired when you get up and have to face another day on the job?"
   ```

3. **Intensity Questions**

   ```
   "Rate the intensity of stress you experience at work"
   Scale: 1 (Very Low) to 10 (Extremely High)
   ```

## Risk Classification

## Scoring Algorithm

### Calculation Method

```typescript
interface BurnoutScore {
  emotionalExhaustion: number; // 0-100
  depersonalization: number; // 0-100
  personalAccomplishment: number; // 0-100 (reverse scored)
  workLifeBalance: number; // 0-100
  organizationalSupport: number; // 0-100 (reverse scored)

  overallScore: number; // Weighted average
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'moderate' | 'high' | 'critical';
}
```

### Weighting System

The overall burnout score uses weighted averages:

- **Emotional Exhaustion**: 30%
- **Depersonalization**: 25%
- **Personal Accomplishment**: 20% (higher scores are better)
- **Work-Life Balance**: 15%
- **Organizational Support**: 10% (higher scores are better)

## Trend Analysis

### Historical Tracking

- **Individual Trends**: Track personal burnout levels over time
- **Team Trends**: Monitor department or team patterns
- **Organizational Trends**: Company-wide burnout indicators
- **Seasonal Analysis**: Identify cyclical patterns

### Predictive Analytics

```typescript
interface BurnoutPrediction {
  currentTrajectory: 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining';
  predictedScore: number;
  confidenceLevel: number;
  timeframe: number; // weeks
  recommendedActions: string[];
}
```

## Early Warning System

### Alert Triggers

   - Performance compared to historical data
   - Cross-reference with productivity metrics

### Notification System

```typescript
interface BurnoutAlert {
  employeeId: string;
  alertType: 'threshold' | 'trend' | 'pattern';
  severity: 'moderate' | 'high' | 'critical';
  message: string;
  recommendedActions: string[];
